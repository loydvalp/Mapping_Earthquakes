# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
   
The purpose of this project is to show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.  In this modulue, I use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.


## Resources
Data Source: Mapbox_API token, Leaflet-Basic-Map, all_week.geojson, GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json, index.html Software: Visual Studio Code 1.45.1, Google Chrome Inspect

## Challenge Overview
The goals of this challenge:

1. Use d3.json() to get tectonic plate data and add the data using the L.geoJSON() layer.
2. Style the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map.
3. Add the tectonic plate data as an overlay with the earthquake data.
4. Add a third map style to allow the user to select from three different maps.
